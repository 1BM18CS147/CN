## Observation for Router Topology
### Procedure
<ul>
<li>A toplogy was created using Router-PT as connecting device and two end evices(PC-0 and PC-1)  using copper cross-over connections</li>
<li>A default gateway is for each end device configured.</li>
<li>A unique IP address was configured for each end device.</li>
<li>The router are configured to the IP address of end devices in Command Line Interface</li>
<li>An ICMP packet was transferred from source to destination via Router as connecting devices</li>
</ul>


### Learning Outcomes

<ul>
<li>What is a router</li>

<li>What is a Ping message.</li>
<li>How a Ping message is sent.</li>
<li>Simulation of the Router Topology.</li>
</ul>
